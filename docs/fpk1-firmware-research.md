# FPK1 firmware reverse-engineering notes

Status: preliminary research, **not a bootable FPK1 machine**. Source: user-supplied Audi Q7 2018 update archive `AU_C1_AU736_0378_1280_prod_8S0906961AK_Q7_2018.zip`. No proprietary firmware binaries committed.

## Platform evidence

Strings previously observed in Stage 1 include `startup-nvidia-tegra3-mm`, `devb-mmcsd-tegra3`, `tegra2_ge` and `fs-qnx6`. Stage 2 includes `qnx-arm-qcc-fpk1` and `RL_QNX_OS_650SP1_MMX2_17.52A`. These strongly suggest an ARMv7/Tegra 3 QNX 6.5 SP1 stack. String evidence is **not** proof that the existing MHI2 boot chain or peripherals are compatible.

Existing machine `hw/arm/mhi2_harman.c` instantiates `Tegra30State`, maps RAM at `0x80000000`, and resets AVP PC to `0x480e0000`. Those are MHI2 implementation details, **not established FPK1 addresses**.

## HSP/update wrapper

The researched `stage1_ifs_SignInfo.xml` reports `START-BYTE-FLASHDATA=186 (0xBA)`, `START-BYTE-SIGNATURE=58`, `SIGNATURE-SIZE=128`, and equal compressed/uncompressed lengths for Stage 1. Eight bytes `41 FF 44 FF 4F FF 44 FF` occur at `0xBA..0xC1`. The working extracted payload begins at `0xC2`, after these eight bytes. Keep **flash-data start** distinct from **candidate raw image start** until wrapper semantics are fully understood.

| Image | Candidate payload bytes after 0xC2 | QNX magic occurrences | ELF magic occurrences | imagefs strings |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| stage1_ifs.img | 2,060,288 | 1 | 41 | 2 |
| stage1_RECOVERY_ifs.img | 8,742,912 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| stage2_ifs.img | 23,056,384 | 0 | 40 | 2 |

Magic/strings counts do not establish valid object boundaries. The `0x00ff7eeb` QNX startup signature occurs at candidate Stage 1 offset `0x808`; a naive startup_header decoding gave inconsistent size fields, so it is **not yet a verified loadable IFS**.

## Stage 2 container and imagefs

Candidate Stage 2 payload has `IFSPTTBL` at `0x7f8`, with two 44-byte records `STAGE2.1` and `STAGE2.2`. The observed Stage2.2 span is `[0x93cc90, 0x15fc090)`, length `0xcbf400`. For Stage2.1, `0x93cc87` and `0x174d718` are observed record values; a compressed/uncompressed length interpretation is **unconfirmed**. Nine bytes separate the candidate Stage2.1 length from the Stage2.2 start.

Within Stage2.2, an imagefs candidate starts at offset `0x890` (relative to Stage2.2), with parsed file records starting `0x908`. A previous pass recovered **344 candidate directory entries**. Two mappings were cross-checked against coherent ARM32 little-endian ELF headers:

| Path | imagefs-relative data offset | Stage2.2 ELF offset | Directory-reported length |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `bin/mostcoreapp` | `0x6000` | `0x6890` | 348,668 |
| `bin/imgdec` | `0x5c000` | `0x5c890` | 32,772 |

ELFs reportedly use `/usr/lib/ldqnx.so.2`. Their names suggest application components, **not** QNX kernel/startup. Importantly, the highest directory-reported end (`0x1bb5e2f`) extends beyond the Stage2.2 stored length. Do **not** assume all 344 entries can be extracted from this region as-is; check imagefs address mapping/packing.

## Remaining work and boot milestones

1. Revalidate imagefs records, file spans, and extract complete, in-bounds files; build a machine-readable manifest.
2. Determine Stage2.1 representation and whether `0x174d718` is an unpacked size.
3. Parse Stage1 QNX startup header against the correct QNX 6.5 layout; locate actual `startup`, `procnto`, and `.script` without guessing.
4. Establish the FPK1 memory map, CPU handoff, UART, flash layout, and boot prerequisites. Compare with `hw/arm/tegra30.c` and MHI2 machine.
5. Only then implement an isolated FPK1 machine profile; boot success means reaching original `procnto` and obtaining diagnostic output before attempting FPK applications or graphics.

Keep binary images out of Git. Preserve exact offsets, coordinate system (archive file vs unwrapped payload vs Stage2.2), hashes and validation commands in future tooling.
